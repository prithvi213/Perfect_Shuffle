## List ADT
In this programming assignment, I learnt how to implement a different style List with a different
style cursor. This was a new experience for me, because this was the first assignment in this 
class which I was doing in C++. Learning C++ while doing this programming assignment was really
fun and it reduced various complications for me in this assignment. I also learnt how to 
implement the shuffling algorithm with the List ADT and was able to keep track of the number of
shuffles it took to get a List to return to its original state. Some new concepts in C++ which I
found to be interesting are operator overloading, using destructors, and understanding the C++
libraries. These tools made it much easier for me to write my code.
